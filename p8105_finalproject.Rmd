Our P8105 group will be looking at voter turnout by state (https://www.electproject.org/2022g, and compare this with the Myers Abortion Facility Database (https://osf.io/8dg7r/).  We will also be using the KFF data set to identify the waiting periods and other laws related to abortion among each state. Specifically, we will be looking at panel distances to the nearest US abortion provider, and also how this changes over time. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, people had a lot of questions on what this meant for the future of reproductive rights. This is what interested us in this topic, so that we can see what how the impact of accessibility of abortion clinics influences the number of voters in a given state. 

Our intended final product is to create a website which has visualizations showing the change in distances to an abortion clinic within each state over time. We also plan to look at abortion bans within each state as a time series. As another visualization we are planning on showing voter turnout over time. An analyses of all three data sets we intend on doing is a linear regression which estimates the distances of the abortion clinics while showing bans/laws within each state with the outcome being the voter turnout. Some possible coding challenges we may run into is combining the data sets, as well as creating a uniform time measure, which may be coded differently among each of our data sets.
